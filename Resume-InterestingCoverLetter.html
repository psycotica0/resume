Hello. Welcome to the source of my resume.

To Whom it may concern, <BR> <BR>
To be direct and to the point, I'm not really sure what a cover letter in an HTML resume is supposed to be. 
Perhaps Microsoft Word exports some kind of magic that makes it seem like a cover letter. 
I don't know.
To me it's all just text, this part just happens to come before the resume part.
I hope you have a similar view in mind. Otherwise, I'm in trouble already.
<BR> <BR>
I'm not really sure where to go from here.
I have developed websites. Never professionally, in the past, so I don't have a portfolio or anything. That being said, I like to think I'm capable.
<BR> <BR>
Also, the record should show that I don't like resumes. They always seem to be all sneaky and exaggerated; as if their purpose is to trick people into hiring us for jobs we would be incompetent at. Thus, I've tried to use as few adjectives as possible in this. I have told you what I have done, and what I can do, and nothing more. Hopefully this is enough.
<BR> <BR>
I'm not sure if this has been interesting, or brief, enough for you. I hope so.
<BR> <BR>
Thanks for reading this far.
<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Christopher Vollick
