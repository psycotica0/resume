					<li> Wow, four months and this is all I can come up with to put here?</li>
					<li> I did other things, but nothing's really springing to mind.</li>
					<li> For instance, I wrote an interface whereby I could plug a number of different renderers onto a set of enumerations pulled from a database, but then the company went another direction and all that code was put out of production. Things like that. </li>

		<h2>Known Programming Languages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> C / C++ </li>
			<li> Java </li>
			<!-- To be honest, I'm not so much a fan of Java-->
			<li> Tcl/Tk </li>
			<!-- Tcl is my favourite -->
			<li> Ruby </li>
			<!-- Ruby's pretty cool too -->
			<li> JavaScript </li>
			<li> Basic SQL </li>
			<li> Does sh count? </li>
			<!-- Even if it does, I don't use it very often -->
			<!-- Whenever something comes up that it would be good for, I just use Tcl -->
			<li> And some more </li>
			<!-- I knew VB once, but I barely remember those times. -->
			<!-- RPGCode was one of my first. Those were good times -->
			<li> And some that I've half learned or still learning </li>
			<!-- Prolog looks neat. -->
			<!-- I also need to find a functional language that I don't hate. -->
			<!-- SML has initial promise. -->
			<!-- I was immediately smitten by the concept of APL -->
			<!-- Unfortunately, I don't have a special keyboard. -->
			<!-- When you aren't using indecipherable characters, some of the magic is lost. -->
			<!-- Also, a good tutorial for it seemed hard to come by -->
			<!-- Forth initially intrigued me, but it ended up being to restricted -->
		</ul>

		If there's anything else I need to know, I could always use an excuse to learn a new language. Or finish learning one, as the case may be.
